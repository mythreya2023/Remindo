# Remindo - Wholesale Saree Marketplace

**Remindo** began as a business idea and quickly transformed into a fully deployed application. It connected wholesalers with retailers to streamline bulk saree purchases. Retailers could browse through a marketplace of wholesalers, choose a shop, explore their products, and place orders that they could track. Meanwhile, wholesalers had full control over their shops, managing products, viewing orders, and communicating with retailers. Remindo also featured **push notifications and email notifications** to ensure every order and update reached the user instantly.

It was **DEPLOYED** in March 2021 and shut down in Dec 2021.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Marketplace View**: Retailers can view and choose from various wholesale shops.
- **Product Listings per Shop**: Each shop displays a full list of available saree products.
- **Bulk Ordering**: Retailers can place bulk orders directly with wholesalers.
- **Real-Time Order Tracking**: Retailers track orders in real-time, and wholesalers track customer activity.
- **Shop Management for Wholesalers**: Wholesalers can create their shop, manage product listings, and track orders.

This project was my first real-time, end-to-end web application, built with a focus on functional, user-driven design and efficient backend operations.
