# Remindo - Wholesale Saree Marketplace

**Remindo** began as a business idea and quickly transformed into a fully deployed application. It connected wholesalers with retailers to streamline bulk saree purchases. Retailers could browse through a marketplace of wholesalers, choose a shop, explore their products, and place orders that they could track. Meanwhile, wholesalers had full control over their shops, managing products, viewing orders, and communicating with retailers. Remindo also featured **push notifications and email notifications** to ensure every order and update reached the user instantly.

It was DEPLOYED in March 2021 and shut down in Dec 2021.
